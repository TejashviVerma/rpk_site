###Here's my new favorite cocktail you can make at home. 

**INGREDIENTS**

- 5 fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered
- 1/4 lime, cut into 2 pieces (thats the trick less lime than a usual caipiroska)
- 3 ginger slices (thumb size)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 cups cracked ice
- vodka

**DIRECTIONS**

Place berries, lime, and ginger in a rocks-glass or a highball. Sprinkle sugar over top; add a teaspoon of vodka and muddle the mixture with a muddler until almost pureed. Add ice and fill the glass with vodka; mix well with a long spoon.

Alternative, if you dont like vodka base you can replace it with Gin, the result is equally awesome!

enjoy!
