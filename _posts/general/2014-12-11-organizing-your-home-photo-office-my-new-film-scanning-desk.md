Currentlly my only desk is in my room, where I have spent many hours of my life studying and programming.
The last year I spent many hours in the same desk scanning and post processign my photos, but sitting there emits the same feeling like I am doing another chore. 
So I though if I wanted to balance personal and professional life and eliminate stress I have to get organized.
While it may seem like a challenge to set your home entertaiment-office apart from the rest of your living-working space, all it requires is giving the matter a little time, thought, and creativity.

So I created a desk from scratch I bought a closet and a self.
Then reorganized my living room to create a new space where I can work on my photo projects and/or write some code for fun.

Lets see some photos of the procces:
